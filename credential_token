 don't know how to validate user @r2evans' comment above, but indeed it worked! I already had a PAT token set, so I followed the steps in https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html#credential-caching, starting at 10.2.1.1

install.packages("gitcreds")
library(gitcreds)
gitcreds_set()
I had to enter my account password (computer password), then it showed my current identification parameters. In the console, three choices appear:

1: Keep these credentials
2: Replace these credentials
3: See the password / token
